# Food Truck Project

## Details
In this app, the user is prompted to enter up to five food trucks with their attributes. 
The user can then choose from a menu to see a list of all the trucks entered, view the average ratings
of the trucks, or view the information of the highest rated truck.

## What I Learned
We need instance of the object in a class to call a non static method in a static method.
This can be accomplished in the main method by making an instance of its own class 
using the default constructor.

We do not need instances to call non static method in another non-static method.

We can re-use same variable name in a loop when assigning new instance to the array. It will get stored
in the array and can be accessed by it's field assignments.

We should use a static field to modify a non-static field such as when assigning an Id.

## Technologies Used
